====================

> For @goestoeleven (Todd Mcleod)'s @golang excerise

Find a problem on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and write a function in go that solves it. Then share it on Github.

Problem Description
-------------------

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
