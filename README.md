Top Dice
========

> For @goestoeleven (Todd Mcleod)'s @golang excerise

Find a problem on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and write a function in go that solves it. Then share it on Github.

Problem Description
-------------------

There are 1111 ways in which five 6-sided dice (sides numbered 1 to 6) can be rolled so that the top three sum to 15. Some examples are:

D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 4,3,6,3,5
D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 4,3,3,5,6
D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 3,3,3,6,6
D1,D2,D3,D4,D5 = 6,6,3,3,3

In how many ways can twenty 12-sided dice (sides numbered 1 to 12) be rolled so that the top ten sum to 70?
